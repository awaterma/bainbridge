## Bainbridge Island repository for Nodeschool

This is an online planning space for Nodeschool meetups on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Everyone invited to this repository is 
someone that I've spoken to about Node in general, or Nodeschool in specific. I am hoping that we can work together and come up 
with a fantastic place to hold several Nodeschool workshops this Spring and Summer. I'm also on the lookout for some help with 
Proctors and Speakers.

I have also setup a Facebook community page to support these efforts, please see [IslandJS](http://www.facebook.com/IslandJS) for 
updates and news driven by this repository.

Welcome!
