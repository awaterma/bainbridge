## Bainbridge Island repository for Nodeschool

This is an online space for Nodeschool meetups on Bainbridge Island, Washington. 

We own the GitHub organization, [IslandJS](https://github.com/IslandJS), which acts as a staging location for different projects used in our workshops on the island. 

We also own a Meetup Page: <http://www.meetup.com/IslandJS-Nodeschool> and Domain: <http://islandjs.org>.

Finally, our Facebook community page also helps to support these efforts, [IslandJS](http://www.facebook.com/IslandJS), and serves as a means to let more people know about the group and our upcoming workshops and meetings!

London Nodeschool has some really excellent advice for our first session, I'm hoping to follow a similar plan on the 23rd, with International Day events mixed in.
