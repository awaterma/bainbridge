## Bainbridge Island repository for Nodeschool

This is an online planning space for Nodeschool meetups on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Everyone invited to this repository is 
someone that I've spoken to about Node in general, or Nodeschool in specific. I am hoping that we can work together and come up 
with a fantastic place to hold several Nodeschool workshops this Spring and Summer. I'm also on the lookout for some help with 
Proctors and Speakers.

I've created the GitHub organization, [IslandJS](https://github.com/IslandJS), to act as a staging location for different projects 
we may want to integrate and use in our workshops on the island. In particular, I've forked the code-dot-org blockly project; which 
would be nice to transform/consume/use into a similar format as the NodeJS workshops.

Finally, I have setup a Facebook community page to support these efforts, please see [IslandJS](http://www.facebook.com/IslandJS) for 
updates and news driven by this repository.

Welcome!
