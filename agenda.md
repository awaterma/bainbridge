## Hour of Code

I've cloned code-dot-org into our repository's group page. I spent some time
this last week investigating the project, and discovered that an interesting set
of "blockly" applications come with a Gruntfile and can be run directly with
Node.js from the command line.

The fact that the projects can be setup to work in such a way makes incorporating
the code-dot-org hour of code's "blockly" programming exercises ideal for use
alongside Nodeschool workshops.

I also like that the projects in the "blockly" application within the code-dot-org
repository aren't the same as the exercises on the published code dot org website.
We can use these as an entry point for students, and then point them to the online
resource to continue learning and experimenting.

## Nodeschool.io

I think we should follow the recommended set of workshoppers:

* [javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)
* [git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it)
* [learn you node](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode)
* [stream-adventure](https://github.com/substack/stream-adventure)

## Suggestions?

Direction? Ideas? Other workshoppers? Helpers? Locations?
