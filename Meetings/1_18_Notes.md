# IslandJS -- Node School on Bainbridge Island
1/18/2014

## Brainstorm

* Start with scheduling a few workshops

* Work with Bainbridge Parks and Rec Department

* Start simple, go by different capabilities of students

## Who can we reach? 

* Number of people we can reach out to? 
* Who are they?
* How do we find them?

### Park and Rec

Tell them that we have a skill that we would like to teach. We would need to have a
larger web presence in place at least a month before we even want to speak with Park 
and Rec.

Start off small, host one or two classes. Go through Bainbridge Island Review,
Islander Magazine, High School, Flyers on the Ferry boat.

### islandjs.org

Put together basic web site at islandjs.org. Possibility to host the website on Ryan's servers. 
A polling mechanism on the page would be helpful; we'd like to use that to research who has
an interest and what their experience with programming is.

### High School

See if we can get contact with the STEM teacher at the high school.

# Next Steps:

## We Need to Reach out and Engage Interest
  * thoughts from Parks & Rec
  * Islander, Bainbridge Review
  * Speak with School about flyers, announcements

## Place to host?

  * Speak with School about renting the library, a classroom
  * Possible other space in town
  * Speak with local businesses

## Nodeschool.io

To proctor and teach, everyone should be at least familiar with the modules we want to teach. We should
all have installed Node and run at least one nodeschool.io module. Please reach out if you are having
trouble installing and getting setup with Node and/or Nodeschool.

## Directions

1. Website
   * Ryan will give Andrew ssh access to his server
   * Andrew will put together simple informational website staged on our shared repo
      * Have a poll on the webiste; trying to figure out what level people are at? Level of expertise with Node
2. High School 
   * Meet with STEM representatitives and see if we can get support
3. Simultaneouly branch out with Parks and Recreation

## Open Questions

* io.js?

* generalhenry/nodeschool-interactive type lesson space setup locally for someone with a laptop but not setup with
Node.
